Convert-XText version 0.01
==========================

RFC1891 defines the xtext encoding for delivery service notifications,
to encode non-standard-ascii characters and special chars in a simple
and fast, as well as easily reversible, way. It is also used for other
purposes, like for proxied mail filters, where the charset used in the
communication is known to be an 8bit ASCII dialect.

The input data for encode_xtext simply converts all characters outside
the range of chr(33) ("!") to chr(126) ("~"), as well as the
plus ("+") and equal ("=") sign, into a plus sign followed by a two
digit uppercase hexadecimal representation of the character code.

For example, the I<"="> sign, ASCII 61 or \x3D, will be converted to
B<+3D>.
